#Content of the work:
  I made a small part of the universe, the scene contains some major planets and some minor asteroids. Clicking on each of the major planets will bring up a different introduction to the planet.

#Creative work:
  First of all, I chose a richer color to distinguish different objects. I think this can give people a sense of visual comfort.
  Secondly, I think that my work can give people a feeling of traveling around the universe.
  Finally, I think the most creative is my imagination of each different planet. very funny!

#Ideas and methods:
  In the first step, I created a three-dimensional world based on the content of session6.
  In the second step, I placed a large number of asteroids to fill the entire universe. Here I used a way to clone the grid and merge the grid to save code.
  In the third part, I started to put in some of my main geometry and differentiated them by changing their materials.
  In the fourth step, there are big planets and some asteroids that revolve around the big planet. Here I set a revolution axis for each planet and put each asteroid into their own pivot point.
  In the fifth step, I added a mouse click event pop-up text box to each planet. Bind the model to the ray collision detection.
